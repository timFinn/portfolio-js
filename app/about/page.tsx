              I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience building real-time 3D 
              applications for public sector, training, and commercial applications. My work focuses on the 
              intersection of game engine technology, system architecture, and emerging AI capabilities.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-100 mt-12 mb-4">Background</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              My journey started at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where I developed a passion 
              for interactive systems and robotics. Since then, I've worked on everything from autonomous 
              vehicles to VR training systems to AI-powered game development tools.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-100 mt-12 mb-4">What I Do</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Currently at HigherEchelon, I lead technical initiatives for the Army Game Studio, including:

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-100 mt-12 mb-4">Technical Philosophy</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I believe in building systems that are performant, maintainable, and deliver measurable value. 
              Whether it's deterministic physics simulation or networked multiplayer architecture, I focus 
              on solutions that work reliably in production environments while pushing technical boundaries.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-100 mt-12 mb-4">Leadership</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              When I'm not coding, I'm exploring emerging technologies and mentoring other developers. I 
              believe in sharing knowledge and contributing to the broader engineering community is 
              the only way to achieve success.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-100 mt-12 mb-4">Beyond Code</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Outside the office I'm regularly exploring emerging technologies and experimenting to identify 
              real world results. I like to apply my technical skills to other domains like horticulture, 
              which gives me a chance to step away from the keyboard. I also enjoy hiking, reading, playing music, and cooking.
